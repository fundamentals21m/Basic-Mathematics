    question: 'What is the multiplicative inverse (reciprocal) of 5?',
    options: ['-5', '5', '1/5', '0'],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: 'The reciprocal of 5 is 1/5, because 5 × (1/5) = 1.',

    options: ['Yes, it is 0', 'Yes, it is 1', 'Yes, it is ∞', 'No'],
    correctIndex: 3,
    explanation: 'Zero has no multiplicative inverse because 0 × (anything) = 0, never 1.',

    explanation: '(1/a) + (1/b) = (b+a)/ab = 1/c. So c = ab/(a+b).',
