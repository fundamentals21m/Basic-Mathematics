    question: 'What is the distance formula for points (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂)?',
    options: [
      'd = √[(x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)²]',

      'd = (x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)²',
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation: 'The distance formula d = √[(x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)²] comes from applying the Pythagorean theorem to the right triangle formed by connecting the two points.',

    question: 'What is the distance between (0, 0) and (3, 4)?',
    options: ['5', '7', '12', '25'],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation: 'd = √(3² + 4²) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5. This is the famous 3-4-5 right triangle.',

    options: ['4', '8', '10', '3'],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation: 'Since both points have the same y-coordinate, the distance is simply |6 - 2| = 4.',

    question: 'What is the distance from the origin to point (5, 12)?',
    options: ['13', '17', '60', '169'],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation: 'd = √(5² + 12²) = √(25 + 144) = √169 = 13. This is the 5-12-13 Pythagorean triple.',

    options: ['5', '7', '√7', '25'],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation: 'd = √[(1-(-3))² + ((-1)-2)²] = √[4² + (-3)²] = √[16 + 9] = √25 = 5.',

    options: ['(1, 1)', '(2, 0)', '(0, 3)', '(-1, -2)'],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation: 'Distances: (1,1) → √2 ≈ 1.41, (2,0) → 2, (0,3) → 3, (-1,-2) → √5 ≈ 2.24. The point (1, 1) at distance √2 is closest.',

    options: ['(5/3, 0)', '(3, 0)', '(2, 0)', '(4, 0)'],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation: 'Let the point be (x, 0). Distance to (0,4) = √(x² + 16). Distance to (6,0) = |x - 6|. Setting equal and squaring: x² + 16 = (x-6)² = x² - 12x + 36. Solving: 16 = -12x + 36, so 12x = 20, x = 5/3.',

    question: 'Triangle ABC has vertices A(0, 0), B(6, 0), and C(3, 4). What type of triangle is it?',
    options: ['Isosceles', 'Equilateral', 'Scalene', 'Right'],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation: 'AB = 6, AC = √(9 + 16) = 5, BC = √(9 + 16) = 5. Since AC = BC = 5, the triangle is isosceles.',

    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation: '√[(x-4)² + (3-(-1))²] = 5. So (x-4)² + 16 = 25, giving (x-4)² = 9. Therefore x - 4 = ±3, so x = 7 or x = 1.',

    options: ['12', '7', '5', '√25 + 7'],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation: 'Side lengths: horizontal = 4, vertical = 3, hypotenuse = √(16 + 9) = 5. Perimeter = 4 + 3 + 5 = 12.',

    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation: 'For point P(x, y): √[(x+2)² + y²] = √[(x-4)² + y²]. Squaring: (x+2)² = (x-4)², so x² + 4x + 4 = x² - 8x + 16. Solving: 12x = 12, x = 1. The perpendicular bisector is the vertical line x = 1.',
